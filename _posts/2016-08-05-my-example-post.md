title: My first day at General Assembly!
---

My first day at General Assembly (GA) started off with clamming hands and a million butterflies in my stomach. I woke up with the realisation that all the pre-work I had been doing, and everything I had quit to start this course was becoming very, VERY real.

I don't normally get nervous, but my golly I was bricking it walking into GA on that sunny August morning. I grabbed a coffee thinking it would help (it just made the shaking worst) and headed into the enterance where I was greeted with a tube carriage. Me being me didn't get the connection at first of the tube carriage, but then the penny dropped and I realised it was a feature from Aldgate East station to which the campus was right next door to.

The first person I saw was Johnnie who I had been chatting with over slack whilst doing the pre-work. I can't remember what I said but it was probably something stupid or a swear word.

Anyway, we get onto the first floor and walk to the classroom where I see everyone for the first time. Now, I was expecting a bunch of utter geeks in my class, you know the stereotype of fire flame shirts, rubbish trainers and social skills of a slug. BAM.... wrong, what I was in fact presented with was a class of gorgeous humans, trendy, bubbly, funny and very welcoming.

Stereotypes can do one in my eyes now!
