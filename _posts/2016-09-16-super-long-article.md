title: "First project!"

Well, today is the day that I have to think about my first EVER project and wow I feel so crazy nervous.

Our blurb for this project was  quite simply to make a simple game using JavaScript. I wanted my first project to be fun, and something that is a talking point, so what better than Kanye West?

I follow Kanye on Twitter and some of his tweets are beyond fresh, for example;

'this next album is gonna be the greatest musical masterpiece since my last album'

'What if Kanye made a song about Kanye?'

'I would like to thank Julius Caesur for originating my hairstyle'

Using his 'deep tweets' i thought it might be fun to develop a hangman style game where the user has to guess the missing parts of a Kanye tweet.
