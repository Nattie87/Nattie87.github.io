            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I’ve recently completed an intense 3 month Web Development course at General Assembly.</p>
          </div>
          <p>I bring my skill set and enthusiasm for development into practice. I pride myself on my communication skills and social skills, and I always hold the moto “A job is not worth doing unless it’s done well”. I’m a hard working person who puts the time and effort into every task given to me. I welcome change and challenges with open arms and I believe this is what life is all about. </p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <p>After years in Publishing I decided to take the almighty yet very exciting leap into Development, and what a journey it's been! Being a Developer is a career I am in love with. Problem solving is my new outlook in life, and I believe a problem in development can always be solved with patience & persistence.</p>
          </div>
          <p>I have just finished a 3 month intensive course at General Assembly (WDI). My time at General Assembly has been the best experience of my life and I am truly thankful for my experience.</p>
          <p>The learning and speed of the course was very fast paced which has prepared me and the class for the real world of development. During the course we learnt so many languages and this switched so often you just had to keep up. Luckily the switching of languages and technologies was met with relative ease.</p>
          <p>Some of the technologies we used were JavaScript, Ruby, Ruby on Rails, jQuery, Express, AngularJS, SQL, CSS, HTML, SASS, Sinatra, NodeJS, Git, plus many more.</p>
          <p>The course not only had a catalogue of languages, but it also presented daily stand ups, presentations for solo and group projects, and lots of pair programming as well as TDD.</p>
